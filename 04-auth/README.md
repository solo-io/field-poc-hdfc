# Workload Identity Chain — SA Token Exchange (Independent Authentication)

Demonstrates a two-hop workload identity chain where every agent authenticates **as itself** at each gateway boundary using Kubernetes ServiceAccount token exchange. Each workload exchanges its auto-mounted SA JWT for a Keycloak access token, **no long-lived secrets**, no token delegation or propagation.

| Hop | Caller | Identity | Enforcement |
|-----|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Caller Agent → AGW → Stock Agent | `azp=chain-caller-agent` | JWT policy on `/agent` HTTPRoute |
| 2 | Stock Agent → AGW → MCP | `azp=chain-stock-agent` | JWT policy on `/mcp` HTTPRoute + CEL RBAC on `mcp-backend` |

## Token Claims at Each Hop

### Hop 1 — Caller Agent to Stock Agent

```json
{
  "iss": "http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080/realms/agw-dev",
  "sub": "<opaque-uuid-for-chain-caller-agent>",
  "azp": "chain-caller-agent",
  "aud": ["agentgateway"],
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

### Hop 2 — Stock Agent to MCP

```json
{
  "iss": "http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080/realms/agw-dev",
  "sub": "<opaque-uuid-for-chain-stock-agent>",
  "azp": "chain-stock-agent",
  "aud": ["agentgateway"],
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

The MCP server and its CEL policy see only the chain-stock-agent identity. The chain-caller-agent is invisible at the MCP boundary — the two security domains are fully isolated.

## Comparison: Chain vs End-to-End Propagation

| | `agent-workload-identity` | `workload-identity-chain` |
|---|---|---|
| `/agent` JWT policy | None — token passes through | Strict — `azp=chain-caller-agent` |
| `/mcp` JWT policy | Strict — `azp=caller-agent` | Strict — `azp=chain-stock-agent` |
| MCP tool RBAC | `jwt.azp == "caller-agent"` | `jwt.azp == "chain-stock-agent"` |
| Identity visible at MCP | `caller-agent` | `chain-stock-agent` only |
| Stock agent code change | None | `MCP_AUTH_MODE=workload` |
| Credential type | Client credentials (K8s Secret) | SA token exchange — no long-lived secrets |
| Keycloak clients | `caller-agent` | `chain-caller-agent` + `chain-stock-agent` (isolated from other use cases) |
| Blast radius if caller-agent compromised | Attacker can call MCP directly | Attacker cannot reach MCP (no chain-stock-agent credentials) |

## Why Two-Hop Identity?

### Blast Radius Isolation

In `agent-workload-identity`, the caller's token flows all the way to MCP. If the caller-agent's credentials are compromised, the attacker has a token that can call MCP tools directly — bypassing the stock agent entirely.

In this use case, the chain-caller-agent's token is only valid for the `/agent` route. It has no power over the `/mcp` route. A compromised chain-caller-agent cannot impersonate chain-stock-agent to MCP.

### Independent Auditability

Each hop produces its own audit trail with a distinct identity:
- AGW logs for `/agent` show `azp=chain-caller-agent`
- AGW logs for `/mcp` show `azp=chain-stock-agent`

This makes it possible to answer "which agent called MCP and how many times?" independently from "which agent called the stock agent?"

### Separation of Concerns

The stock agent's MCP authorization policy (`jwt.azp == "chain-stock-agent"`) is completely decoupled from who called the stock agent. You can add new callers (batch-agent, scheduler-agent) without changing the MCP policy — as long as they can reach the stock agent, the stock agent handles MCP authentication.

## Tool-Level Access Control

The CEL RBAC policy on the `mcp-backend` `AgentgatewayBackend` restricts which tools the chain-stock-agent identity may invoke:

```yaml
matchExpressions:
  - 'jwt.azp == "chain-stock-agent" && mcp.tool.name == "get_stock_price"'
```

This is enforced at the backend level, after the `/mcp` JWT policy has already validated the token. Two-layer enforcement:

1. **JWT auth** — is the token valid and issued for this gateway? (`aud=agentgateway`)
2. **CEL RBAC** — is this workload authorized to call this specific tool? (`azp=chain-stock-agent && tool=get_stock_price`)

Future policies can differentiate tool access by workload identity:

```yaml
matchExpressions:
  - 'jwt.azp == "chain-stock-agent" && mcp.tool.name == "get_stock_price"'
  - 'jwt.azp == "admin-agent"'   # admin-agent can call all tools
```

## Architecture: Steps and Resources

| Step | Feature | Resources Created |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | `providers` | HTTPRoute `/openai`, provider config |
| 2 | `mcp-server` | Deployment `stock-server-mcp`, AgentgatewayBackend `mcp-backend`, HTTPRoute `/mcp` |
| 3 | Keycloak addon (profile) | Keycloak client `chain-caller-agent` + audience mapper + K8s Secret `chain-caller-agent-credentials` |
| 4 | Keycloak addon (profile) | Keycloak client `chain-stock-agent` + audience mapper + K8s Secret `chain-stock-agent-credentials` |
| 5 | `obo-token-exchange` | `EnterpriseAgentgatewayPolicy` `chain-stock-agent-jwt-policy` on HTTPRoute `stock-agent` |
| 6 | `obo-token-exchange` | `EnterpriseAgentgatewayPolicy` `chain-mcp-jwt-policy` on HTTPRoute `mcp` |
| 7 | `mcp-tool-access` | `EnterpriseAgentgatewayPolicy` `chain-mcp-tool-access` on AgentgatewayBackend `mcp-backend` |
| 8 | `workload-agent` | Deployment `stock-agent` (`MCP_AUTH_MODE=workload`, `useTokenExchange: true`), Service, ServiceAccount, HTTPRoute `/agent` |
| 9 | `workload-agent` | Deployment `caller-agent` (`useTokenExchange: true`), Service, ServiceAccount, HTTPRoute `/caller-agent` |

## Running

```bash
# Build both agent images
cd samples/stock-agent && make build
cd samples/caller-agent && make build

# Deploy the use case
node src/cli.js usecase deploy workload-identity-chain

# Test it — both hops are independently authenticated
curl -X POST http://<gateway-ip>:8080/caller-agent/run \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "What is the current stock price of AAPL?"}'

# Verify the first hop is enforced — direct call without a token is blocked
curl -X POST http://<gateway-ip>:8080/agent/run \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "What is the price of AAPL?"}'
  # → 401 Unauthorized

# Verify the second hop is enforced — caller-agent token cannot reach MCP directly
# (caller-agent token has azp=chain-caller-agent, not azp=chain-stock-agent)
```

## `MCP_AUTH_MODE=workload` in the Stock Agent

When deployed in this use case, the stock agent has `MCP_AUTH_MODE=workload` in its environment. This activates `WorkloadMCPTokenProvider` in `samples/stock-agent/server/stock_agent/agent.py`:

```python
if _MCP_AUTH_MODE == "workload":
    from .workload_auth import WorkloadMCPTokenProvider as _WorkloadMCPTokenProvider
    _mcp_header_provider = _WorkloadMCPTokenProvider().header_provider
else:
    from agentsts.adk import ADKTokenPropagationPlugin as _ADKTokenPropagationPlugin
    _mcp_header_provider = _ADKTokenPropagationPlugin().header_provider
```

`WorkloadMCPTokenProvider` reads the auto-mounted ServiceAccount JWT at `/var/run/secrets/tokens/sa-token` and exchanges it for a Keycloak access token (`azp=chain-stock-agent`) via RFC 8693 token exchange. The token is cached in-memory and refreshed 30 seconds before expiry. No `CLIENT_SECRET` or K8s Secret is required.
